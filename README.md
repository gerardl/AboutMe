My name is Gerard Lucas and I'm a senior software developer based in St. Louis, MO.  
I lead development of software solutions across many industries including manufacturing,  
food & beverage, and pharmaceutical. I work daily as a full-stack developer across multiple technologies  
while also gathering requirements, creating technical specifications, and designing complex large-scale projects.  

Over the last 11 years I've worked in a variety of programming languages and frameworks including  
*C#, Java, JavaScript, React, React-Native, Vue, Swift, C++, SQL, EF/EF Core*, and many more.  
I also have experience designing for and integrating with a variety of HMIs, PLCs, and micro-controllers and  
have developed complex batch recipe management systems that work with *Rockwell Factory Talk Batch*.
